## Midterm Proposal
### Good Outcome 
<p>
Platormer where each platorm moves around with the amplitude of different instruments of a song that all mix together to a song. You have to hear the different parts to be able to time how to get through. Power ups play a slower version of the song so it's easier to move through
</p>
### Better Outcome
<p>
If you do good, the next level is breakcore and insane.
